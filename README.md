# Yet Another Meteor Boilerplate

**!! This project is a work-in-progress, see checklist below !!**

This boilerplate is designed to be a comprehensive starting point for any web/mobile/desktop application. It includes all the latest bells and whistles and takes care of all the boring repetitive parts of starting a new application.

We have selected an extensive list of curated tools and libraries which we have found to have the best developer experience together with the best documentation and community support.

**Objectives:**
* Built using latest UI and dev best-practices
* Most commonly needed functionality included out-of-the-box
* Full typescript support

**The stack mainly consists of:**
* [Meteor](https://meteor.com/)
* [React](https://react.dev/)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
* [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

**The following is also included by default:**
* Authentication (login, logout, register, forgot-password, profile page)
* Basic hackable navigation
* Authenticated and unauthentiated routes and layouts
* Example Collection
* Example page with data fetching
* Simple admin backend with user management (invites and crud users)
* CI config
* [Meteor Up](https://meteor-up.com/)
* [Server-side Rendering](https://docs.meteor.com/packages/server-render.html)
* [Email handling](https://docs.meteor.com/api/email.html)
